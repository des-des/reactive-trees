### l-systems
Nice abstraction to help procedurally generate trees/plants. By defining a simple set of growth rules I can create, with much greater complex + variety, more interesting trees. Rules are basically a set of transoformations from chars to strings. Each char can be thought of as a logo command (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). Applied recusively on some starting strings, very basic rules can create a complicated set of commands that will draw interesting plant-like objects (and some other cool fractals).
